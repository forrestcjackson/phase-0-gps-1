I struggled on remembering which branch to merge to which and for pulling from GitHub.

Pushing and merging were much more clear with the help of Matt and Regina. Pulling is still slightly troubling but it makes more sense now than before.

I mostly needed clarification on what I thought was true versus what was actually true. The workflow makes sense for the most part.

Pulling from GitHub. Also I suppose deciding which branch to commit.

It was nice. There were some technical difficulties that slowed us down, we worked past it. Also we were stuck on pushing getting non-fast-forward errors, but cloned another repo and made sure sublime was closed before trying again fixed it.
