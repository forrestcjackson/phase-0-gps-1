1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Pulling, Merging, and fetching were proving to be fairly confusing.
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * Branching and pushing makes solid sense, but there's still some aspects of git and github in general that feels unfamiliar. Like there is a narrow path that I can go down where everything works and makes sense, but if I get off that path, I feel totally stumped.
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * Mostly confirmation. I remembered that I needed to do something, but I wasn't sure exactly what the proper command was, or in what order.
4. What still confuses you about Git?
  * Merging conflicts. I think mainly because the examples we've worked with are a bit contrived, so it's hard to really appreciate the value of this process.
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * Good! I was nervous. My inner critic was all upons my business.
